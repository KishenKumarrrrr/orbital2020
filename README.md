# orbital2020: STUDYSMART

### Prototype hosted: https://sheltered-atoll-56102.herokuapp.com

### Proposed Level of Achievement: Vostok

## Project Scope:

A web application that provides students with the ability to create flashcards online and arrange them according to folders. Users will be able to have cards unique to their user IDs.

## Motivation
Everyday, students are bombarded with large amounts of content, spanning multiple modules, that they have to internalise. While they are clear on what they have to know, it remains a challenge developing an efficient system that will help them internalise the content. 

Instead of going through entire chunks of content, wouldnâ€™t it be nice to only have to revisit the content that you are unsure of or are going to forget? We want to leverage on the proven technique of spaced repetition and memory curves to optimize the studying process. We aim to not only streamline the process of studying, but give students real time feedback on which areas of their content they are weak in so they can direct more effort to those areas. Say goodbye to long hours of studying with a new and effective approach! 

## Core features
The Web Application will feature multiple decks of flashcards, stored in a database unique to each user. Users will be able to organise module content within a deck by constructing flash cards for that specific deck. Users will have a log/sign in page (authentication) to gain access to their individual decks. Cards are created by users themselves as they go about their studies, they are not auto-generated by the system in order to ensure that the students process this data before being testing on it.

### There is also an option to edit the cards if needed.

Each time a flash card is reviewed, the user provides feedback on the difficulty of the review. Based on the difficulty, a next review data is tagged to the card and the card does not surface again until that date.

## User Stories:

1.	As a student who has multiple modules, I want to be able to manage all the content I need to know in one place.
2.	As a student who is revising for exams, I want to be able to quickly identify the areas that I am weak in so I can focus more on those topics.
3.	As a student, I would like to review only the content that I have to and not waste unnecessary time reviewing content I already know well.
4.	As a student, I would like to be able to know how productive I am in revising for an exam and how frequently I should be revising concepts with varying difficulties.
